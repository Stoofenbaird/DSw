            <h2>Landscapes: Objective vs. Subjective</h2>
            <p>My current artwork is based on investigating identity, place, and gesture.  The latest series is an elegy to Cy Twombly incorporating ink on paper and mixed media using a landscape motif. Challenging surface space and overlapping a gestural identity within the naturalistic imagery excites me.</p>
            <p>What is the interaction of place, identity and gesture? How can I create direct-gestural-textural color/tonal moments within the scope of a landscape? How can I modify a sense of place with a gestural identity, questioning object-ness versus perception using color, tone, and texture?</p>
            <h4> <p>Approach the surface as a history:</p> </h4>
            <p>The images I use are my own, gathered when I travel, hike, etc. The format is typically horizontal landscapes, at times in multiples, together.  The line-based works are typically in ink/mixed-media and are layered to arrive at the image, especially in the Cy Twombly &quot;Elegy&quot; series.</p>
            <h4> <p>Pen &amp; Ink on Paper</p></h4>
            <p> Each work is faithfully based on the photograph.  The content of the work is between the sense of place and the identity of the place, which is the overlap of intuition and narration. This overlap is never concrete.  There are gestures and moments considered complete, and those are what I look for.</p>
            <p>One of the satisfactions of these line-based works is showing the process openly. While overlapping is still a significant element, the individual lines can be traced and followed versus the obscuring that happens in layers of wax and paint. </p>
            <h4> <p>Paintings and Collage Paintings</p></h4>
            <p> The paintings, while faithful to the character of each subject landscape, are more inferences of a place rather than an explicit description. Often, by mingling parts (panels) of different landscapes into a single composition, the viewer is invited to explore, at will, individual areas or the complete whole.</p>
            <p>Color, tone and texture become starring characters, overshadowing the landscape details themselves.</p>
            <p>With paintings, my objective is to build a multi-level history with the layers of paint.  This idea is futher developed in the painting-collage works in which the pages of a book are adhered to a canvas and then paint is applied over the book pages.  Although each of these painting-collages typically carry the same title as the book that forms its substrate, there is no relationship between the book's contents and the landscape images that I apply over the pages.</p>
            <h4> <p>Graphic Design</p></h4>
            <p>  Graphic design work provides an opportunity to approach artwork from an attitude of &quot;team.&quot; Creating customized packaging and logos, synchronizing the client's business needs with my own explorations of line, color, shape and texture is fun.</p>
